    <p><strong>How does the delivery process work?</strong></p>
<p>Once our system processes your order, your products are inspected thoroughly to ensure they are in a perfect condition.<br />After they pass through the final round of quality check, they are packed and handed over to our trusted delivery partner.<br />Our delivery partners then bring the package to you at the earliest possiblity. In case, they are unable to reach your provided address or at a suitable time, they will contact you to resolve the issue.<br />International Shipping – International clients do not pay import duties levied by their government to Beautybebo. Clients will have to pay the customs duty to the courier provider in order to receive the product.</p>
<p><strong>How are items packaged?</strong></p>
<p>We package our products in boxes, which are covered in a plastic layer. Each individual product is packaged in bubble wrap while fragile items like bottles are safely secured with additional bubble wrap.<br />We pride ourselves on the quality of our packaging.</p>

<p>We usually dispatch most orders within 1-4 business days (excluding Sundays and public holidays)</p>
<p>Though, we keep 95% of our catalog in our inventory, certain products need to be sourced directly from the Supplier so that we can live up to our promise of providing fresh, non-expired products.<br />While we are trying our best to avoid this situation, these products might delay your order. However, in case of international orders, product delivery may get delayed due to reasons attributable to logistics, public holidays, etc.<br />If you are ordering our products from a Mega Sale event, dispatches may be a bit delayed due to increased volumes. We will target to dispatch all orders within 5 days of order date.</p>
